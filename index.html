      			<p>Jessica Ticzon is a full-time student at the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in Somerset, NJ.  For the past 11 years of her life, she has dedicated herself to pursing a career in nursing.  However, she has always been interested in technology and the endless possiblities that coding can provide.  So, to the shock of her family and (some) friends, she decided to do a complete career change into the fast-paced and exciting world of web development!</p>

      			<p>After completing the bootcamp, Jessica hopes to use her new skills for good by getting a job with a non-profit or healthcare company.</p>

      			<p>When Jessica is not pulling her hair out from coding, she enjoys eating, cooking, and spending time with her family, fiance, and dog.</p>
